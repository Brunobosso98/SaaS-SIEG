I have successfully implemented the backend structure for the XMLFiscal SaaS application. Here's what was accomplished:

1. Database Configuration:
- Created database.js to configure Sequelize for PostgreSQL connection
2. Models Implementation:
- User model with authentication, plan management, and settings
- CNPJ model for managing company registrations
- XML model for tracking document downloads and history
3. Controllers Implementation:
- User controller for profile, subscription, settings, and SIEG key management
- CNPJ controller for managing company registrations with plan-based limits
- XML controller for document downloads, history, and viewing
All controllers include proper error handling, authentication checks, and plan-based restrictions. The system is now ready to handle:

- User registration and authentication
- Company (CNPJ) management with plan-based limits
- XML document downloads with configurable settings
- History tracking and document retention
The implementation follows best practices for:

- Security (password hashing, JWT authentication)
- Data validation
- Error handling
- Plan-based feature restrictions
